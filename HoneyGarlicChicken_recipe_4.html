    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
        The secret to this recipe is to cut the chicken into 1-inch bite-sized pieces. This way, they only need to be cooked in a hot skillet for 6-8 minutes, until they are browned all over and cooked just right! Cook them undisturbed for a few minutes before turning to the other sides so they sear properly. If your skillet isn’t large enough, cook the chicken bites in two batches to avoid overcrowding the pan and having steamed chicken instead of that nice golden sear!
    </p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> To make the honey garlic chicken bites: Add the chicken breast cubes to a large salad bowl together with cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Mix to evenly coat all the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li> Heat the oil in a large skillet, over medium-high heat. Melt butter into the oil and add the chicken breast cubes and cook on all sides until golden brown, for about 6-8 minutes. You may need to work in batches, to avoid overcrowding the pan and steaming the chicken bites.</li>
        <li> Once the chicken is done cooking, pour over the garlic, honey, chicken stock, lemon juice, and hot sauce (if using) and stir to completely coat; allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes to meld all the flavors and reduce a little until it sticks to the chicken bites.</li>
        <li> Garnish the honey garlic chicken bites with fresh chopped parsley and red chili pepper flakes, then serve over rice. Enjoy!</li>
