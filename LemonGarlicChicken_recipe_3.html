    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
        Remove chicken thighs from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before cooking to bring them close to room temperature.
        We use boneless and skinless chicken thighs because they render less fat and cook quicker than bone-in. Plus, it is easier to rub the spice mixture deep into the chicken meat.
        Season chicken thighs just before cooking to prevent drawing out moisture and drying out the meat. If you want to let it sit longer, omit the salt from the spice mixture, and add it 10 minutes before cooking.
        You can add crispy bacon to the green beans for a nice flavor.
        You can use chicken tenders instead of chicken thighs for a variant of this chicken thighs recipe. They’re delicious and cook faster! Just keep an eye on it so they don’t overcook and dry up.
    </p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel. You want to remove excess moisture so the chicken will brown properly.</li>
        <li>2. Combine the onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. </li>
        <li>3. Rub the chicken thighs generously with the seasoning mixture. Set aside while you prepare green beans.</li>
        <li>4.  Arrange the green beans in a microwave-safe dish with 1/2 cup (125ml) water and cook in the microwave for 8-10 minutes until almost done but still crisp.</li>
        <li>5. Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-low heat and melt 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
        <li>6. Place the seasoned chicken thighs top side down in the hot skillet and cook, until golden, about 5-6 minutes, then flip the chicken thighs and cook another 5-6 minutes, until cooked through and a cooking thermometer displays 165°F (75°C). If the chicken browns too quickly, lower the heat. Adjust timing depending on the thickness. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>7. In the same skillet, lower the heat and melt the remaining tablespoon of butter. Add chopped parsley, garlic, hot sauce, red crushed chili pepper flakes, and pre-cooked green beans and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until cooked to your liking. Add lemon juice and chicken stock and reduce the sauce for a couple of minutes, until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>8. Push green beans to the side, place the chicken back in the pan with the sauce, and reheat quickly. Adjust seasoning chicken with pepper.</li>
        <li>9. Serve the lemon garlic butter chicken thighs warm, garnished with more crushed chili pepper, fresh parsley, and a slice of lemon if you like. Enjoy!</li>
