    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
        When searing the diced pork, ensure the oil and butter in your pan are hot before adding the meat to get a nice golden sear. Use a large pan to avoid over-crowding and simmering pork in its juice. You want the pork to fry, not steam!
        For the best flavors, like the pork in this recipe, use freshly minced garlic, not garlic powder.
        Try this pork bites recipe with pork tenderloin. It’s more expensive but worth a try!
        If you don’t have boneless pork chops, ground pork will also make a good option to make the stir-fry.
        This pork stir-fry makes a base of choice to which you can add any veggies you like: bell peppers, onion, mushrooms, broccoli, etc…

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> To make the honey garlic pork stir-fry: Add the diced pork to a large salad bowl with cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Mix to coat all the pork pieces evenly.</li>
        <li> Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Melt butter into the oil, add the seasoned pork cubes, and cook on all sides until golden brown, for about 6-8 minutes. You may need to work in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan and steaming the pork bites instead of browning them.</li>
        <li> Once the pork is done cooking, pour over the garlic, honey, chicken stock (or beef stock), lemon juice, and hot sauce (if using) and stir to coat completely; allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes to meld all the flavors and reduce a little until it sticks to the pork bites.</li>
        <li> Garnish the honey garlic pork bites with fresh chopped parsley and red chili pepper flakes, then serve over your side of choice. Enjoy! </li>
    </ul>
