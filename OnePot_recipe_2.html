    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
        Work to cut the chicken into regular-sized pieces so it cooks evenly. Be careful not to overcook the chicken; otherwise, it will be dry and tough.
        Stir-fry your vegetables until tender-crisp, not too soft and mushy.
        This chicken recipe with vegetables is all about the spicy Cajun flavors, don’t skimp on seasoning!
        Diced boneless skinless chicken thighs will work great too. Add a few extra minutes to cook time.
        You can blanch the broccoli florets in boiling water before throwing them into the skillet if you like them more tender.
        Add a drizzle of lemon juice to brighten up the chicken if you like.

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> To make the Chicken Bites and Vegetable Skillet: In a large bowl add the chicken breast cubes and season with salt and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and cajun seasoning and toss until coated.</li>
        <li> Heat a large skillet over medium heat with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add seasoned chicken bites and cook for 5-7 minutes until the chicken is cooked. Remove to a plate and set aside</li>
        <li> In the same skillet, stir fry the onion (add a little olive oil if needed) for 2 minutes, then add broccoli, zucchini, and bell pepper. Season with Cajun seasoning and cook on medium until vegetables are crisp-tender.</li>
        <li> Deglaze with chicken stock, then add the cooked chicken bites back to the skillet and mix to combine. If desired, garnish with red chili pepper flakes and fresh parsley, and serve the chicken bites and vegetables immediately. Enjoy!</li>
